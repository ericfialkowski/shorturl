# shorturl

This is my experiment in making a url shortener somewhat as described in the book 
"Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills" by Brian P. Hogan.

# Goals for this project
 - Improve Go skills
 - Improve Docker & Kubernetes skills
 - Take a simple monolithic app and scale it further than it needs (for science!)
 - Have fun (probably the most important)
